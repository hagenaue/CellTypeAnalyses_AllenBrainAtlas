# CellTypeAnalyses_AllenBrainAtlas

###This repository contains the full code for the cell type analyses applied to the Allen Brain Atlas 160 brain region Agilent microarray data included in the manuscript "INFERENCE OF CELL-TYPE COMPOSITION FROM HUMAN BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATASETS ILLUMINATES THE EFFECTS OF AGE, MANNER OF DEATH, DISSECTION, AND PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS" (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/25/089391)

###Please note that this code is not easily generalizable - it primarily represents the documentation for all analyses used in our paper. For those of you who are interested in applying similar techniques to your own data, we do have a simplified, generalized version available at https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender.

###The original microarray data was downloaded from http://human.brain-map.org/microarray/search on December 2015. For anyone who is interested, I have a concatenated version of that file (referred to as "ABA_AllProbesNoEmptyRow.csv" in the code), but it is too large to upload to github even with compression, so I have placed it on Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/a/umich.edu/file/d/0B9s8t9_1ysFqMS1pY0ZFRTV5TTg/view?usp=sharing).
